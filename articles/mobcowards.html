  <h1>Cowardice and the Mob: A Love Story</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Welcome to the Age of Cowardice</h2>
    <p>The real pandemic isn’t ideology — it’s cowardice. Cowards in suits. Cowards in hashtags. Cowards in mobs. Weakness is now sold as virtue, and mobs are praised as moral authorities. Strip away the slogans, and what you see is the same rot: people too afraid to think, too soft to speak up, and too desperate for power to care about truth.</p>

    <h2>Mob Mentality: Cowardice with Backup</h2>
    <p>Cowards don’t stand up — they gang up. They don’t argue — they cancel. They don’t build — they burn. They trade moral reasoning for emotional tantrums, and they do it in packs. Because the mob gives them what they lack alone: a sense of righteousness without the burden of being right.</p>

    <h2>Modern Feminism: Strength That Shatters on Contact</h2>
    <p>Feminism used to stand for strength. Now it stands for fragility. Today’s feminists cry over jokes, demand apologies for tone, and treat disagreement as violence. They preach empowerment while needing trigger warnings for conversation. This isn’t strength — it’s tyranny dressed in trauma.</p>

    <h2>BLM: Justice Hijacked by the Mob</h2>
    <p>Black Lives Matter began with truth. It ended in fire. Cities burned, people died, and anyone who questioned the chaos was called racist. David Dorn, a Black cop, died protecting a store — no media outrage. Kyle Rittenhouse defended himself — the media made him a villain. Facts don’t matter to cowards. Only the approved narrative does.</p>

    <h2>Corporations: When “Professional” Means Spineless</h2>
    <p>Once, professionalism meant integrity. Now it means submission. Modern companies don’t stand for values — they kneel for trends. Say the wrong thing on Twitter, and you’re fired. Wear the wrong shirt to a meeting, and HR investigates. These companies are scared of mobs, scared of opinions, scared of their own shadows.</p>

    <h2>Yeonmi Park and the North Korean Ivy League</h2>
    <p>Yeonmi Park escaped North Korea and enrolled at Columbia. She thought she’d found freedom. Instead, she found a culture more obsessed with censorship and ideology than the dictatorship she fled. Cowardice has no borders. It just wears different uniforms.</p>

    <h2>India’s Moral Police: Sanskar Thugs in Disguise</h2>
    <p>In India, cowards wear the disguise of "sanskar" and "tradition". On Valentine’s Day, they beat up couples for “defending culture.” But where are they when rape happens? When murder happens? They vanish. Because they don’t care about morality — they care about control. They are the same as woke mobs — just with different chants. They dance to vulgar songs with barely clad women even on holy festivals, but still maintain that they are "religious".
    <br><br>
    And as a Hindu myself, I hope they live long enough to watch the world move on without them. To realize their fake morality, their performative rage, their power-by-victimhood strategy — it was all temporary. Disposable. Forgotten. Like yesterday’s hashtag. I hope they cry themselves to sleep at night, not because someone hurt them, but because they finally see just how pathetic, hollow, and meaningless their lives truly are.</p>

    <h2>The Anatomy of Cultural Collapse</h2>
    <p>Every mob starts with a coward. One too afraid to stand alone, so they hide in numbers. One too insecure to debate, so they scream instead. One too ignorant to listen, so they cancel. This isn’t justice. This is the death of discourse, disguised as progress.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>If You Belong to These Mobs…</h2>
    <p>If you cry about speech but cheer for censorship… if you burn cities but call it justice… if you assault couples to protect culture… if you call yourself a professional but have no backbone…</p>
    <p>Then I hope — with every fiber of my being — that truth finds you, exposes you, and leaves you humiliated.</p>
    <p>You deserve to be wrecked. Not gently. Not politely. Not metaphorically. But completely, thoroughly, publicly — by reality, by truth, by everyone finally growing the spine you never had.</p>
