  <h1>Technical Indicators: Religion for the Statistically Illiterate</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>The Cult of the Candle</h2>
    <p>Once upon a time, before Python and pandas, traders looked at charts and saw prophecy. Double tops. Golden crosses. RSI signals sent from the heavens. They believed price followed rules — that a few lines and patterns could tame chaos.</p>
    <p>They weren’t stupid — just human. Human brains crave patterns. And technical indicators offer a seductive lie: that the future is knowable through the past, and that you can make money with enough squiggly lines on a chart.</p>

    <h2>The Unholy Trinity: RSI, MACD, Fibonacci</h2>
    <p><strong>RSI:</strong> The “overbought” myth. Over 70? Sell. Under 30? Buy. Except… markets stay “overbought” for months and melt your shorts in the process. RSI doesn’t predict reversals. It just tells you something went up. Cool story.</p>
    <p><strong>MACD:</strong> The delay king. People stare at MACD crossovers like they’re gospel, forgetting it’s just momentum — lagged. By the time it crosses, the move happened. Thanks for the late report, MACD.</p>
    <p><strong>Fibonacci:</strong> Nothing like drawing sacred math lines based on medieval rabbit math to determine modern stock prices. 61.8% is the golden retracement, not because it works — but because enough traders believe it should. This is financial placebo.</p>

    <h2>Yes, They Work — Sometimes</h2>
    <p>Every trader has the story: “I saw RSI divergence on the 15-min chart, caught the reversal, made 600%.” Cool. And the 29 other times RSI lied and nuked your account?</p>
    <p>Here’s the uncomfortable truth: <strong>technical indicators are descriptive, not predictive</strong>. They describe what just happened. They don’t tell you what’s next. And in a market driven by narratives, liquidity, and meme-stock chaos, that’s a problem.</p>

    <h2>Why Traders Worship False Gods</h2>
    <p>Indicators offer comfort. They make chaos look orderly. They wrap unpredictability in math-scented incense and call it “analysis.” But if your edge comes from a free TradingView script, it’s probably not an edge — it’s a myth.</p>
    <p>This is the part people hate to hear: if a simple indicator combo could beat the market, the market would’ve killed it already. Bots would’ve eaten it alive. Alpha dies the moment it’s obvious.</p>

    <h2>Use Tools — But Don’t Worship Them</h2>
    <p>Use RSI if it helps you filter noise. Use moving averages to visualize trend. Use Fibonacci if it makes you feel spiritual. But for the love of volatility, <strong>don’t treat these things like prophecy</strong>.</p>
    <p>The market doesn’t care about your MACD cross. It cares about liquidity, positioning, emotion, news, and sometimes… just pure chaos. If you want to trade well, stop looking for divine signs and start thinking in probabilities, risk, and context.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
    <p>Indicators are tools. That’s it. Tools can help — or hurt — depending on who’s holding them. The problem isn’t RSI or MACD. It’s when you stop thinking critically and start trading like a true believer.</p>
    <p>Because at the end of the day, <strong>price doesn’t care about your indicators</strong>.</p>
    <p>And the market doesn’t hand out refunds for bad religion.</p>
