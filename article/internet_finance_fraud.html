  <h1>The Internet Finance Fraud Epidemic</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>And Why You’re Falling for It</h2>
    <p>
      Let’s be real — online trading “education” is a circus. Especially on YouTube, where every other video hawks some $49.99/month Discord with “real insider knowledge.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Spoiler: you don’t get any. If you pay, you’re the sucker.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one posting flashy 30-min trading videos every few days with bulls and bears making out in the thumbnail is trading seriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one in rented Lambos, flexing cash, is trading seriously. No one who has the energy to be a full-time content creator focused on selling you the “secret skills” is trading seriously.

    <h2>Because Trading Is Not a Vibe</h2>
    <p>
      Trading isn’t a flashy side quest. It’s exhausting. It’s stressful. Most people lose money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seriously, there’s a saying:<br>
      <em>90% of retail traders lose 90% of their money in 90 days.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Your favorite YouTube guru with the Deadpool profile pic promising “market secrets”? Fraud. The guy selling a custom indicator that “automatically trades for you”? Probably fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if you buy into that, you’re umm... regarded. Highly regarded.
    </p>

    <h2>There’s No Shortcut</h2>
    <p>
      No strategy always works. No tool guarantees profits. Most indicators just simplify what the chart is already screaming at you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Want to get better? Learn to sit with the chaos. Accept that the market is… well, a bit of a b!tch — and still control your emotions, think clearly, and don’t freak out. That’s when progress happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      So please, don’t give your money to random guys with big words. If you’re gonna waste it, at least give it to me. I can double it in 20 days an— just kidding. (…Unless?)
